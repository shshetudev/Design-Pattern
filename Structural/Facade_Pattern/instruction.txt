Implementation:
=====
1. Shape is an interface and Circle, Rectangle and Square will implement it.
Shape interface has a method named: draw(): void and each of the inherited class has their own implementations.
2. Create a class named Shapemaker. Inside this class create an object of each of the inherited classes and create 3 different methods calling the specified classes : draw() method.
3. Create a FacadePatternDemo class and create an object inside that and call all the different methods.

Example: 
========
1. Compiler works.
2. Beautiful Home.

Pros:
====
1. Gives a nice inteface. Hides implementation.

Cons:
=====
1. Oversimplification, Leaky abstruction.
2. Over verticalization, creates a facade which is so specific, a single change in use case will change the whole implementation.
